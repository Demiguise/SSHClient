Ensure secure buffer is secure.
Add more algorithms for crypto, kex and MAC.
Select best match for SSH algorithms based on client/remote KEX init packets.

Add public key authentication method.
Handle password change requests.

Ensure channels respect window sizes and max packet lengths.
Add pseudo-tty channel type.
Handle all possible Channel messages.

Add disconnect reasons so users can more easily figure out what went wrong.
Unify logging so that multiple systems can log for any given SSH client. (I.E. KEX should be able to log out, not just SSH_Impl.cpp)

Protect send queue from threading issues, since it may be edited by both the user's thread and the async poll thread.

Check for un-needed copies through API.
Look at improving the API by removing raw pointers, if possible.
Look at improving the API by removing buffer pointer/buf len pairs, unifying them.

Add an example set of files for different methods of using the API (Lambdas or binding an object's functions).
